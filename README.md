# Schedule

Schedule for our group

# Description

This is website. On the main page there is a schedule for currend and next day. Also, you can see schedule for all week. It is possible to see more details for each subject, if you want. 

There are some subjects which take place one time in two weeks depending on the parity of the week. And it is difficult to compute which subjects are on the current week and whick are not. So I decide to develop this website, which can help me and my groupmates to check schedule.

# Moderation

There is a special page which is called 'auth.php'. If you know login and password, you can add, change or delete any information on this site.

# Technology stack

I use HTML and CSS for frontend and PHP and MySQL for backend.
